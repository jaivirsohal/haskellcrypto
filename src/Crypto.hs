{-
The advantage of symmetric encryption schemes like AES is that they are efficient
and we can encrypt data of arbitrary size. The problem is how to share the key.
The flaw of the RSA is that it is slow and we can only encrypt data of size lower
than the RSA modulus n, usually around 1024 bits (64 bits for this exercise!).

We usually encrypt messages with a private encryption scheme like AES-256 with
a symmetric key k. The key k of fixed size 256 bits for example is then exchanged
via the aymmetric RSA.
